# RentACar
A simple .NET Core REST API assignment, done with MongoDB.
To get it running you have to install a MongoDB instance or maybe use the free cloud option called Atlas. You can change the connection string in the appsettings.json included in the solution. 

There are already some basic API calls inside the PostmanExamples folder. Just import the file into your postman client and start testing.
